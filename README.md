## The backend server for the Digital Superstore

Akinlouwa Olumuyide - Lead Backend Developer

This project was assigned to my team by our Object Oriented Programming lecturer.

We show all the different principles of Object Oriented Programming and how they can be used in a real world application, while building a RESTful API at the same time.

So far so good, we have the Classes folder which stores the classes for the different objects we need to create and use to implement the OOP principles.

The API was written in TypeScript which compiles down to JavaScript.
